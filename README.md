# Adventure-and-Maze-game-using-Pygame
This project was done with one of my colleagues, Raghu Alluri. We were both interested in learning about the Pygame platform in python, as such, we chose to take on this project. 
Personally, I wanted to make an adventure game, and Raghu wanted to make a maze game, and as such, we decided to make both.
Over the course of a few weeks, we went from not knowing anything about Pygame, to building our first successful game!
